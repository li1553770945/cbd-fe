    "abstract":"Machine Learning (ML) models and AI systems heavily rely on the training over large scale of data and the data from different domains. It is critically important to encourage data owners to share their data out for the training of AI systems. However, data are often fragmented, as they are collected by different institutions and managed locally. It is difficult to share data across multiple institutions. In this talk, we will address the three key challenging issues that hinder the data sharing for the training of ML models: 1) lack of secure platform that data owners can authorize their data to specific users for specific applications, so that the data can only be utilized for the authorized purpose and nothing else; 2) lack of contribution-based data valuation scheme and incentives for data sharing. Data owners do not receive their deserved share of the profit generated from their data; 3) lack of unlearning scheme that allows data owners to withdraw their data from a trained-model. We will also present our solutions to these issues.",

    "abstract":"Farming and food security are the foundations human servival and society stability. In this talk,  we discuss how artificial intelligence and IoT can help improve farm productivity and efficiency. Using information from remote sensing, weather forecasting and ground sensors, combined with advanced algorithms, we aim at making intelligent decisions based on real-time data as well as human expertise. We also designed unmanned farm vehicles to reduce farming labor intensity and to improve operation precision. We will discuss challenges and future roads towards industrializing this old form of economy. ",

    "abstract": "Cloud computing is considered as one of the most prominent paradigms in the information technology industry, since it can significantly reduce the costs of hardware and software resources in computing infrastructure. This convenience has enabled corporations to efficiently use cloud storage as a mechanism to share data and cloud computing as a mechanism to outsource computing. One of the most important works in the area of cloud computing is how to provide security protections. The work in the cryptography literature has been very rich in this area, as it has been studied in the past two decades. In this lecture, we will revisit the topics that researchers have been studying. Specifically, we will provide an overview on what research topic that was studied, and currently being studied in the literature. We provide a comprehensive understanding of cloud computing research based on the published papers spanning from 2007 to 2023. Furthermore, we also discuss the gap between theory and the implementation of the proposed solutions.",
