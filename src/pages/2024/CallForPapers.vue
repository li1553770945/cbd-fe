  <h2>Scope of Conference</h2>
  <p>The International Conference on Advanced Cloud and Big Data (CBD) provides a forum for both academics and
      practitioners working on cloud computing and big data technologies to explore new ideas, share their experiences
      and leverage each other's perspectives. Besides the latest research achievements, this conference also covers
      cloud/big data industry practices and their broad applications, and gives all participants a chance to identify
      the new/emerging “hot” trends in these areas. We solicit original papers on a wide range of cloud computing and
      big data topics that can be divided into three tracks but are not limited to:</p>
